# P3_Pakudex
COP3502 Project 3

The project is intended to simulate the function of Pokemon decks through classes and objects to represent “creatures” and a cataloging system. 
	In this Pakudex, the user will store that Pakuri. Upon start, a user menu will display, and the user will choose to list Pakuri, Show Pakuri, Add Pakuri, Evolve Pakrui, Sort Pakuri or Exit. If the user chooses to add a Pakuri to their Pakudex or evolve a Pakuri, the console will prompt the user to input the name of the species.
